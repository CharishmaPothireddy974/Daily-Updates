---------------------------------------------------------------------Singleton Pattern Doubts--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:- In many ways, the Singleton Pattern is a convention for ensuring one and only one object is instantiated for a given class. If you’ve got a better one, the 
world would like to hear about it; but remember, like all patterns, the Singleton Pattern is a time-tested method for ensuring only one object gets created. The Singleton 
Pattern also gives us a global point of access, just like a global variable, but without the downsides.

What downsides?

Well, here’s one example: if you assign an object to a global variable, then that object might be created
when your application begins. Right? What if this object is resource intensive and your application never ends
up using it? As you will see, with the Singleton Pattern, we can create our objects only when they are needed.

Answer:-
🧠 What is the Singleton Pattern?
The Singleton Pattern is a design pattern used in object-oriented programming (like Java) to ensure only one object (or instance) of a class is ever created throughout the 
life of your application.
  Ex:- You can think of it like a single manager in an office — there should only be one manager, no matter how many people join the office.

📍 Why do we need Singleton?
Because sometimes:
      -> You want a single configuration manager
      -> You need one database connection
      -> You have one logging system

Multiple instances can lead to conflicts, duplicate work, or unnecessary resource usage.

💡 Global Variables vs Singleton
Now let’s explain the part you didn’t understand — the difference between a global variable and a Singleton, and the downsides of global variables.

✅ Global Variable:
          public class App {
              public static HeavyObject obj = new HeavyObject();
          }
In the above example, HeavyObject is created as soon as your app starts — even if you never use it. That’s wasteful if the object is resource-intensive 
(uses a lot of memory/CPU).

✅ Singleton:
          public class HeavyObject {
              private static HeavyObject instance;
          
              private HeavyObject() {
                  System.out.println("HeavyObject created!");
              }
          
              public static HeavyObject getInstance() {
                  if (instance == null) {
                      instance = new HeavyObject(); // created only when needed!
                  }
                  return instance;
              }
          }

          public class Main {
              public static void main(String[] args) {
                  System.out.println("App started.");
                  // HeavyObject not created yet!
          
                  // Now create only when needed:
                  HeavyObject obj = HeavyObject.getInstance();
              }
          }
Output:
      App started.
      HeavyObject created!
So the Singleton pattern: ✅ Saves memory
                          ✅ Delays creation until needed
                          ✅ Gives controlled access to only one instance

🚫 Downsides of Global Variables:
Created early – Even when not needed
Hard to manage – Any class can change it
Testing becomes harder – Global state can cause unpredictable behavior

✅ Benefits of Singleton Pattern:
Lazy Initialization – created when needed
One instance only
Central access point (like a controlled global)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:- Yes, you technically can delay the creation, but not when you use this syntax:
public static HeavyObject obj = new HeavyObject(); // ❌ Created immediately when class loads
This line immediately creates the HeavyObject when the App class is loaded — even before main() runs or before you use obj.
what does this mean explain the flow in more detail 

Answer:- Let's go deep into what actually happens in memory and during execution when you write this line:
        public static HeavyObject obj = new HeavyObject();

🧠 To understand this, you need to know:
Java goes through 3 main steps when it runs a program:
        Class Loading
        Class Initialization (Static blocks + static fields)
        main() Execution

✅ Let's say we have this code:
          public class HeavyObject {
              public HeavyObject() {
                  System.out.println("HeavyObject created");
              }
          }
          
          public class App {
              public static HeavyObject obj = new HeavyObject(); // Static variable with assignment
          
              public static void main(String[] args) {
                  System.out.println("Inside main");
              }
          }

🔍 What happens step by step?
1. Class Loading
        . Java looks for the main() method in class App.
        . The JVM loads the App class into memory.
        . While loading, it sees public static HeavyObject obj = new HeavyObject();

2. Static Initialization
Since obj is a static variable with an assignment, JVM immediately executes: obj = new HeavyObject(); So the constructor of HeavyObject is called even before main() runs.
Output:- HeavyObject created
         Inside main
Even though you never used obj in main(), it's still created 😬

❗ Why is this a problem?
If HeavyObject is:
      Large (uses lots of memory)
      Expensive (takes time to construct)
      Or just not needed (maybe user doesn't go to the page that uses it)
Then you've wasted resources by creating it early.

Extended Question:- i will have Main.java where i just have App.java instance and in App.java i just have this public static HeavyObject obj=new HeavyObject();
then this works right then why singleton

Answer:- Yes — this does work. ✅ So... why bother with Singleton? 😅 Let’s break it down 👇

✅ YOUR APPROACH: works fine for small/simple apps
// App.java
public class App {
    public static HeavyObject obj = new HeavyObject();
}

// Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HeavyObject h = App.obj;
    }
}

Yes — this works perfectly.
BUT… 🛑

⚠️ Problems appear in real-world apps:
Let’s say you’re building something like your Hospital Hub Nexus or AI shopping assistant — then your app might have:
      Multiple modules (services, controllers, utilities, etc.)
      Multithreading (concurrent users or background tasks)
      Expensive objects like: Database connections, Loggers, Configuration managers, AI models or REST API clients
Now imagine all of those trying to use your App.obj — it becomes hard to:

        Problem	                        Why it’s a problem
❌ No control over access        	Anyone can change obj accidentally
❌ Eager creation	                It gets created even if unused
❌ Thread-unsafe                	In multi-threading, it can cause race conditions
❌ Tight coupling                	Everyone depends on App.obj — not flexible or testable

✅ Singleton fixes all of this:
      Lazy Initialization: Only created when needed
      Controlled Access: Only through getInstance()
      Thread-Safe: Can make it synchronized
      More flexible: Easy to add logging, config, error-handling inside getInstance()

✅ Conclusion:
    ✅ Your approach works and is great for small apps or demo projects.
    🚀 Singleton is better when you want clean, safe, scalable, and professional code.
